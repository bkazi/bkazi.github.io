              Worked on a music request app for a client, in a team of 6 as part of the Software Product Engineering unit. Made use of React, Redux, Webpack, GraphQL and ExpressJS while working on the project. The app involved common social media aspects such as a feed along with more specific features such as finding events based on proximity.<br>
              My particular focus was on the front end involving React where I implemented the animations for the app and other visual details. I also implemented offline functionality using service workers, with the potential of push notifications.

            </div>
            <p>
              A two member team worked on a project using Java that involved creation of the model of the Scotland Yard board game to complete the provided MVC framework and yield a playable version of the game.<br>
              The second part of the project was to design an AI system to play the game and so we employed the Monte Carlo algorithm to pick the best move from the game tree. Additionally I used ThreadPools and other classes from the Concurrent package to improve performance along with heuristically scoring each board.
